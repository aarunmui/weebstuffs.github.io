    <h4>The Irregular At Magic Highschool</h4>
    

    <img src=106668.jpg alt "cover pic"><br>
    <p>The anime series is set in the late 21st century. It seems to have been made in an alternate version of reality. As per the history, the Third World War has already taken place. It has divided the world into four superpowers – the United States of North America (USNA), the New Soviet Union, the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan.<br>
    The magic exists in this time. Thriving through the ages, it has become more polished with technology. In this 21st century, magic has been made into a systematized technology and is being taught as a technical discipline around the world. But, there is a catch. It is that genetics determine who can use magic. Not everyone can utilize magic power.<br>
    Japan has got a self-regulating magical community. A group of ten Master Clans under the government governs the magical community in Japan. The original magicians in Japan are few and limited in number. However, people have been forced into magical education and magic-related professions. There are a total of 9 magic teaching school. Each specializes in one aspect of magic.<br>
    This show mainly revolves around two siblings – Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba. The duo gets enrolled at the First High School, a prestigious institute for magicians. The schools divide the enrolled students into two different groups based on their entrance exam scores. The top students’ group called Blooms gets the school’s First Course. The second one Weeds get the Second Course.<br>
    Getting a high score, Miyuki gets admitted to the First Course while Tatsuya couldn’t get good marks. So, he gets assigned to the Second one. Despite being magically inept, Tatsuya has got extraordinary technical knowledge, magical techniques, and physical combat abilities. These things make him ‘irregular’ at magic school separating him from other Weeds.

    However, everything changes in a single night when he notices a girl across the street on his way home. Enraptured by her overwhelming cuteness, it's love at first sight for Nasa. But in his infatuated daze, he fails to notice the approaching danger speeding down the road and finds himself at death's door. Barely alive thanks to the girl's intervention, Nasa musters the courage to confess his love to her, fearing she might otherwise vanish from his life.
